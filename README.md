# Alfons: AI-Powered Prior Authorization Assistant

**Alfons automates healthcare prior authorization calls, eliminating manual data entry and reducing processing time from hours to minutes.**

## How It Works

**Provider Workflow Simulation**: Alfons acts as a healthcare provider's prior authorization assistant that makes outbound calls to insurance companies, conducts professional conversations with insurance representatives, and automatically extracts and populates authorization data into EHR systems.

**Demo Experience**: 
1. Provider enters patient details and insurance company phone number
2. Alfons calls the insurance company (you playing the insurance rep)
3. Alfons professionally requests prior authorization details
4. As you provide information verbally, watch real-time EHR field population
5. Complete audit trail and structured data extraction eliminates manual entry
